# Explanatory Models in Cognitive Neuroscience: Code, Notebooks, and Materials

This repository contains some basic notebooks to introduce the fundamentals of model-based cognitive neuroscience. Specifically, it contains examples and code for the following topics:

1. Introduction: An introduction to modeling with an an illustrated example.

2. Reinforcement Learning

3. Accumulator models

4. Models of long-term memory

5. Artificial Neural Networks. 

To use the repository code, you might either download it on your computer and open the notebooks with Jupyter or Jupyter-lab (included in the Anaconda Python distribution), or open any notebook on your favorite browser using Binder by clicking on the button below.
